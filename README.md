# Random-Password-Generator-os-random-

Working: Character Pools: Uses string.ascii_letters for uppercase and lowercase letters. string.digits and string.punctuation provide numbers and special characters, respectively.

Ensure Diversity: The script guarantees the password includes at least one letter, digit, and special character.

Randomization: Additional characters are chosen randomly from all pools combined. The password is shuffled to avoid predictable patterns.

Error Handling: Ensures the password length is at least 4 to accommodate one character from each category.
